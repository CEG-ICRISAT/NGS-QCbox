NGS-QCbox is a commandline pipeline that enables NGS quality control to be performed with ease. The outputs include base and read level statistics, genome coverage and variant infomation.

REQUIREMENTS
Java v1.6/1.7/1.8
bash >= v4(assuming that you are working on Linux environment)
Python >= v2.6
(These are mostly  available on Linux platforms by default)

INSTALL
$ tar zxvf  NGS-QCBox-v1.0.tar.gz
$ cd NGS-QCbox-v1.0
$ ls


Follow either Quick mode/ Complete mode instructions

NGSQCbox-v1.0.py is the main script that parallelizes the tasks for multiple samples generated from hiseq or miseq.
The user needs to provide a list of samplenames and their coresponding min/max insert sizes in a file in the current dir in the following prescribed  format:
$ cat list
sample1:500:700
sample2:550:800
sample3:300:600
sample4:450:760

PREREQUISITES
Remember to set the path for reference (fasta format), bowtie2-index  and genome size in the complete_qc.bpipe / quick_qc.bpipe in qcbin dir.
Also one can set the number of processors available in NGSQCbox-v1.0.py - default is set to 10 processors.

$ NGSQCbox-v1.0.py <enter>  
1) MiSeq Quick mode
2) MiSeq complete mode
3) HiSeq quick mode
4) HiSeq complete mode

ASSUMPTIONS
-The input fastq files ate gzip compressed format (*.fastq.gz).
-
-The quality range is assumed to be in phred+33 format.

RESULTS
-The pipeline generates two files namely, detailed_QC.txt and QC_final.txt.
detailed_QC.txt contains information on counts of reads, bases, read length range, counts of A/T/G/C/N, percentage of GC content and quality range
QC_final.txt contains reads generated and retained after quality trimming, pecentage of alignment, genome coverage at 1X to 15X and mean read depth observed from alignment.


DISCLAIMER
-This tool has been tested on Linux platform only (ubuntu 12.10). It should work on any other linux flavour provided you have the tools in REQUIREMENTS.
